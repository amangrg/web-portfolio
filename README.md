# Portfolio

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio. 

This is also my primary website going forward, hosted at https://amangarg.in

To run it locally use

yarn dev
