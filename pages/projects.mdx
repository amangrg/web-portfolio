  <h1>Engineering stories that blend design, data, and empathy.</h1>
  <p>
    Here are two projects that capture how I bridge research and real-world impact&mdash;one brings air
    quality data to communities, the other decodes brain states from neural signals.

      <h2>USA Pollution Map</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Built an interactive leaflet web app that layers AQI, particulate matter, and ozone data across
      the United States. The experience empowers residents and policy makers to explore temporal
      trends, compare regions, and surface hotspots using intuitive filters.
    </p>
    <ul className="project-card__bullets">
      <li>Implemented performant map tiling and clustering for nationwide data coverage.</li>
      <li>Crafted responsive visual storytelling that helped the project become an IEEE BHI finalist.</li>
      <li>
        Tech: React, Leaflet, GeoJSON, Netlify. <a href="https://pollutionmap.netlify.app/">Live demo</a>

      <h2>Brain State Modeling with ARHMMs</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Modeled player cognition in esports scenarios by fusing EEG signals with autoregressive hidden
      Markov models. The pipeline uncovers state transitions that align with high-pressure in-game
      events and reveals individualized neural signatures.
    </p>
    <ul className="project-card__bullets">
      <li>
        Engineered frequency-domain feature extraction (delta through gamma bands) using multi-taper
        spectral analysis to retain discriminative patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evaluated ARHMM, CNN, and logistic regression baselines&mdash;achieving 81% accuracy on kill
        event detection while highlighting subject-level variability via t-SNE explorations.
      </li>
