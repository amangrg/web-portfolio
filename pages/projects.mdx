  <h1>Projects that show how I approach real-world data.</h1>
  <p>
    Each piece started with a question. How can residents understand changing air quality? What can
    EEG signals tell coaches about decision making? These are the experiments I'm most proud of.

      <h2>USA Pollution Map</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      An interactive Leaflet web app that brings AQI, particulate matter, and ozone data onto one
      responsive map of the United States. Local organizers use it to compare regions and explain
      what is changing to their communities.
    </p>
    <ul className="project-card__bullets">
      <li>Implemented custom tiling, clustering, and legends so the map stays responsive at scale.</li>
      <li>The storytelling work led to an IEEE BHI 2024 finalist spot and invited demos.</li>
      <li>
        Tech: React, Leaflet, GeoJSON, Netlify. <a href="https://pollutionmap.netlify.app/">Live demo</a>

      <h2>Brain State Modeling with ARHMMs</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Modeled player cognition in esports scenarios by pairing EEG recordings with autoregressive
      hidden Markov models. The work surfaces state transitions that line up with high-pressure game
      moments and highlights how each player responds.
    </p>
    <ul className="project-card__bullets">
      <li>Engineered frequency-domain features (delta through gamma bands) with multi-taper spectral analysis.</li>
      <li>Benchmarked ARHMM, CNN, and logistic regression baselines and reached 81% accuracy on kill detection.</li>
