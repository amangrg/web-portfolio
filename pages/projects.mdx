  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>
    A closer look at the systems, visualizations, and scientific tooling I build. Each project weaves together product intuition,
    rigorous engineering, and thoughtful storytelling—including ongoing EEG research with Georgia Tech&apos;s BRAINML Lab.

      <h2>Visualization of U.S. Air Pollution</h2>
      <p>
        An interactive map experience that layers EPA data, satellite imagery, and public health context to make air quality
        disparities tangible. The experience powers civic discussions and was recognized as an IEEE BHI 2024 finalist.

      <ul className="project-meta">
        <li>
          <strong>Highlights:</strong> Dynamic filtering across pollutants and seasons, animation-ready time series, and direct calls
          to action for environmental advocates.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stack:</strong> React, Leaflet, Python ETL, Netlify, Mapbox basemaps.</li>

      <h2>Brain State Modeling with Hidden Markov Models</h2>
      <p>
        A computational neuroscience study decoding player performance in MOBA games from EEG signals. Autoregressive HMMs and
        convolutional models reveal the neural signatures of high-intensity kill and death events while surfacing subject-level
        variability in attention.
      </p>
      <ul className="project-meta">
        <li>
          <strong>Highlights:</strong> Achieved 81% accuracy on high-signal subjects, uncovered band power features linked to in-game
          actions, and compared HMMs with logistic regression baselines.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Python, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, t-SNE visualization.</li>

    I&apos;m continually iterating on these projects—deploying richer datasets, adding predictive insights, and refining storytelling.
    Have an idea or a dataset you want to bring to life? Reach out at <a href="mailto:aman.garg@gatech.edu">aman.garg@gatech.edu</a>.
    I&apos;m also exploring full-time machine learning and applied research roles beginning May 2026.
