  <h1>Designing immersive digital experiences powered by data.</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Aman Garg, a full-stack engineer and machine learning practitioner with 5+ years of
    experience shipping resilient products across cloud, web, and AI. I build systems that feel
    effortless for users&mdash;from microfrontends that reach millions of Walmart shoppers to deep
    learning pipelines reconstructing 3D microscopy in the cloud.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Currently at Georgia Tech honing computational science chops, I translate research-backed
      insights into human-centered products. Previously at Walmart and Siemens, I led engineering
      efforts that modernized legacy ecosystems, accelerated releases from months to days, and
      supported multimillion-dollar contracts. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams where ML models,
      cloud architecture, and design thinking intersect to solve challenging problems.
