  <h2 className="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I&apos;m a computational science graduate student at Georgia Tech focused on machine learning for scientific discovery and neurotechnology. In the BRAINML Lab, I collaborate with neuroscientists to decode EEG data, prototype interpretability tooling, and ship research infrastructure that scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before grad school, I led large-scale web initiatives at Walmart and Siemens, shipping microfrontends, SDKs, and production services that touch millions of shoppers worldwide. Across research and industry, I&apos;ve migrated imaging toolkits to Azure with a <strong>10× speedup</strong>, delivered real-time map editing experiences, and crafted recommendation engines from thousands of academic resources. I thrive when I can pair data-rich systems with thoughtful design to unlock measurable impact.

  <h2 className="section-title">Beyond the Resume</h2>
  <p>
    When I&apos;m not experimenting with neural data or polishing product flows, you&apos;ll find me writing poetry, sketching, or digging into strategy games. I care deeply about mentorship and inclusive tech communities, and I&apos;m actively building teams that welcome curious collaborators.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&apos;m looking to join a mission-driven team in May 2026. If that resonates with you, let&apos;s chat—whether it&apos;s about cloud-native science platforms, neuroadaptive interfaces, or your next big idea.
