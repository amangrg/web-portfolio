# Aman Garg

Hey, welcome to my porfolio website and personal blog!

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Walmart Global Tech.](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html) My linkedin profile can be viewed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanmakesart/).

This website is a home for my writing, web-projects and artwork. I write poetry, short stories and make blog posts about things I find fascinating. When not trying to make something new, I like playing chess and listening to music.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). The source code for this website can be viewed [here](https://github.com/amangrg/web-portfolio).
