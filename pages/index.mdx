# Aman Garg

Hey, welcome to my porfolio website and personal blog!

I'm Aman Garg, an ex-Senior dev currently pursuing an MS degree at Georgia Institute of Technology in Computational Science and Engineering. My linkedin profile can be viewed [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanmakesart/). My primary motivation in pursuing this interdisciplinary degree was learning scientific machine learning techniques.

I am looking for Summer 2025 software dev/ ML internships in the US. If you have any leads for me do reach out at aman.garg@gatech.edu

This website is a home for my writing, web-projects and artwork. I write poetry, short stories and make blog posts about things I find fascinating. When not trying to make something new, I like playing chess and listening to music.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). The source code for this website can be viewed [here](https://github.com/amangrg/web-portfolio).
