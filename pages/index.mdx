  <h1>Hi, I'm Aman. I build dependable products for teams who work with data.</h1>
  <p>
    I enjoy the messy middle where research, design, and shipping code overlap. I'm finishing an
    MS in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech after five years of building
    production systems at Walmart and Siemens. Lately I've been running cloud pipelines for 3D
    microscopy at Carl Zeiss XRM and refining machine learning workflows that scientists use every
    day.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My path has moved between large platforms and small research groups. At Walmart I helped a
      cross-functional crew replace a legacy layout system with microfrontends that shipped in days
      instead of months. At Siemens I earned my stripes handling production incidents while
      iterating on Active Workspace. Graduate school has added more applied math and signal
      processing to the mix, which is now showing up in my work on neural data and scientific
      imaging.

      <h3>Cloud &amp; AI at Scale</h3>
      <p>
        Moving an in-house 3D reconstruction toolkit to Azure meant containerizing services,
        building Python pipelines, and tuning GPU workloads. The rework cut processing time for the
        microscopy team from hours to minutes.

      <h3>Product Velocity</h3>
      <p>
        At Walmart I co-led Quick Mods, a project that replaced spreadsheets and manual releases
        with TypeScript microfrontends. Store layouts now land in production within ten days, which
        opened the door for merchandising teams to experiment.

      <h3>Human-Centered Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        Whether it's decoding EEG signals or visualizing air quality, I try to ship tools that make
        complex data approachable. Prototypes only stick when the people who need them can explore
        and trust the results.

    <h2>Next role</h2>
    <p>
      I'm beginning my search for full-time software roles that start in May 2026. If you are
      building products at the intersection of data, research, and user experience, I'd love to hear
      from you.
