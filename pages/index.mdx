    I build end-to-end products that blend compassionate UX with rigorous engineering—from Azure-native 3D reconstruction pipelines to high-impact retail microfrontends. Now, I&apos;m advancing brain-computer interface research at Georgia Tech&apos;s <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRAINML Lab</a>, modeling cognitive state transitions from EEG data and crafting reproducible tooling. I&apos;m actively exploring full-time machine learning and applied research roles starting May 2026.

  <h2 className="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I&apos;m a computational science graduate student at Georgia Tech focused on machine learning for scientific discovery. In the BRAINML Lab, I lead EEG modeling and experiment tooling that reveal how teams collaborate under pressure. Before grad school, I led large-scale web initiatives at Walmart and Siemens, shipping microfrontends, SDKs, and production services that touched millions of shoppers worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across research and industry, I&apos;ve migrated imaging toolkits to Azure with a <strong>10× speedup</strong>, delivered real-time map editing experiences, and crafted recommendation engines from thousands of academic resources. I&apos;m energized by collaborative teams, generous mentorship, and the chance to translate complex ideas into intuitive, elegant products—and I&apos;m ready to bring that energy to a full-time role in 2026.

  <h2 className="section-title">Beyond the Resume</h2>
  <p>
    When I&apos;m not experimenting with neural data or polishing product flows, you&apos;ll find me writing poetry, sketching, or digging into strategy games. I care deeply about mentorship and inclusive tech communities, and I&apos;m actively preparing for full-time machine learning and applied research roles starting May 2026.
