    I design end-to-end products that blend human-centered experiences with rigorous engineering—from Azure-native 3D reconstruction pipelines to high-impact retail microfrontends. Currently, I&apos;m exploring scientific machine learning at Georgia Tech while driving cloud acceleration at Carl Zeiss XRM.

  <h2 className="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I&apos;m a computational science graduate student at Georgia Tech focused on machine learning for scientific discovery. Before grad school, I led large-scale web initiatives at Walmart and Siemens, shipping microfrontends, SDKs, and production services that touch millions of shoppers worldwide. I thrive when I can pair data-rich systems with thoughtful design to unlock measurable business impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across research and industry, I&apos;ve migrated imaging toolkits to Azure with a <strong>10× speedup</strong>, delivered real-time map editing experiences, and crafted recommendation engines from thousands of academic resources. I&apos;m energized by collaborative teams, generous mentorship, and the chance to translate complex ideas into intuitive, elegant products.

  <h2 className="section-title">Beyond the Resume</h2>
  <p>
    When I&apos;m not experimenting with neural data or polishing product flows, you&apos;ll find me writing poetry, sketching, or digging into strategy games. I care deeply about mentorship and inclusive tech communities, and I&apos;m actively seeking Summer 2025 software and ML internships in the U.S.
